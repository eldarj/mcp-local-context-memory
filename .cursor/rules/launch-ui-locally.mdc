# Launching the Knowledge Base UI

Prefer running the UI locally with uvicorn instead of using Docker.

## Install dependencies (one-time)

```bash
pip install -r ui/requirements.txt
```

## Start the UI

From the project root:

```bash
uvicorn ui.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

Then open http://localhost:8000

## Notes

- The app auto-detects `data/db.sqlite` relative to the project root — no `DATA_DIR` env var needed.
- Static files are served from `ui/static/` — CSS/JS changes reflect immediately with `--reload`.
- Do NOT use `docker compose up ui` unless specifically asked. The Docker setup requires Colima/Docker Desktop and has caused platform-specific build issues.
